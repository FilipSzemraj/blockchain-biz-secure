I am currently working on this project, which is in a highly advanced state. However, I need to wait before uploading the files until I submit my engineering thesis due to potential plagiarism concerns and a lack of time to create a satisfactory repository. For now, a presentation is available in the main folder to provide an initial overview.
This project consists of five separate IDE projects, complementing the main work.
